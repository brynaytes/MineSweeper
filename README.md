# MineSweeper
A game of Mine Sweeper made with JavaScript and HTML
Instructions:
To begin a game, click a difficulty level or enter your prefered game specifications into the input spaces (you can do some insanely big game boards).
Clicking GO will generate a new game according to your input. 
Left clicking will reveal what's hidden in a space.
Right clicking will place a ? in the space to designate where you suspect a bomb will be.

How to play:
Clicking on a space will reveal a number. That number tells you how many bombs are surrounding it in eight directions.
You win by uncovering every space without a bomb, and loose by finding one.


The project wasn't for a class or anything, I just wanted to get better at working with JS. I learned a lot from this process (Especially about debugging), and in the end I was happy with the result.
