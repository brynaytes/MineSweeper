# MineSweeper
A game of Mine Sweeper made with JavaScript and HTML

This is probably my first "fully finished" project, and quite frankly at this point the longest one ive done that is actually useable. 
Its not absolutely perfect, but for the most part no large issues pop up 99% of the time (Its not entirely imposible for two bombs to be in the same position). 

The project wasnt for a class or anything, I just wanted to get better at working with JS. I learned a lot from this process (Especially about debuging), and in the end I was happy with my result.
